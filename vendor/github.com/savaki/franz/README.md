# Franz

go library that implements kafka protocol only; based heavily on the work in segmentio/kafka-go

Unlike other libraries that implement high level kafka readers.  Franz is 
intended only to implement the core Kafka api protocol.

### Segment

Thanks to Segment for creating kafka-go, the kafka library that much of this is based on.
